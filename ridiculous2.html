<p>In elementary school, we were taking a field <i>trip</i> to , <b>Philadelphia</b>, and our bus driver did not want us to talk or sing on the bus. <br>Because phones were not supposed to be on the trip, we were all just sitting there in silence waiting to get off the bus. <br>It felt like the longest bus ride ever, and when we got off the bus we were all talking about how jealous we were of the other bus. <br>On the ride home, our teacher had a discussion with the bus driver, and we were allowed to have discussions. </p> <hr>
